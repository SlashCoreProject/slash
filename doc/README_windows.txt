=====================

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run slash-qt.exe.

Slash Core is the original Slash client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Slash transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

See the slash wiki at:

for more help and information.
